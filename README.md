## Prerequisites
We recommend running all the things in a Linux environment. 
Please create a conda environment with all required packages, and activate the environment by the following commands:
```
$ conda create -n pyserini python==3.10
$ conda activate pyserini
```
We have used [pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini) for each search. 

Install via PyPI:
```
$ pip install pyserini
```
Pyserini is built on Python 3.10 (other versions might work, but YMMV) and Java 21 (due to its dependency on [Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini)).
